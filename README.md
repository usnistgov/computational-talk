# computational-talk
This repository contains use case examples for reproducibility focused tools and services.
It was initiated as a support material for the NIST computational Talk:

- Reproducibility and Decimination: https://slides.com/faicalyannickcongo/reproducibility-dissemination#/
- October 26, 2017.

The use cases focus on how to package and disseminate in a reproducibile fashion the scikit-learn digits recognitoon example code.
The experiment is located in the folder **original**.
The other folders contains the ways this experiement should be structured to be packaged as discussed.
